Remapping XYZ Space to 3 Part Harmony:  "Chord-inants... get it?"  

This application is a musical thinking tool.  It remaps our spatial sense to out auditory sense. 
We can now hear space and see harmony; 

Your position X (left,right), Y (up, down) and Z (forward, back) become pitch-shifting
controllers of 3 separate musical notes. This means that every location in space is a "possibly-harmonic" location. 
Like pokemon floating in special places, this world has orbs that show you the exact locations of Major Chords, Minor Chords, and more.  

Never-before have we had the accessible, 3D space-tracking and augmented reality capabilities the hololens provides.  We exploit that power to visualize, and auralize, space. 
 
This enables a new ability to interact with the building blocks of music: harmonic realtionships.
